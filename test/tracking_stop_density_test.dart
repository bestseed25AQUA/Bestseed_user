// Stop DENSITY on long multi-drop routes.
//
// REPORTED (Adithya, bookings #1063-#1067): on the Hyderabad→Chennai run the
// leg from Tirupati to Chennai showed no intermediate places — "have 12 hours
// gap and in that gap fill 6-10 locations".
//
// The old counts were fixed buckets: 12 stops for anything 200-500 km, 15 up to
// 1000 km. On a 524 km route that put stops ~42 km apart, so the ~130 km final
// leg earned only about 3. Past 200 km the count is now proportional to
// distance, holding density roughly constant however long the route runs.
//
// Stops are generated CLIENT-SIDE (TrackingStopsService → GoogleMapsService).
// The backend has a RouteTimelineService that could do this, but it is not
// wired into /farmer/vehicle_tracking/{id} and was deliberately left untouched.
